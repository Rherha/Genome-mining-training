## üéØ Project Overview

This repository documents my self-directed training in computational approaches to natural product discovery, specifically focusing on biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) identification and genome mining using antiSMASH and the Galaxy bioinformatics platform.

As a botany graduate researcher specializing in endophyte bioprospecting for therapeutic application, I'm developing computational skills to complement my wet-lab expertise and enable more efficient natural product discovery pipelines .

## üî¨ Background & Motivation
      
My undergraduate research focused on isolating and characterizing antifungal metabolites from endophytic microorganisms in medicinal plants. While traditional bioassay-guided isolation is valuable, genome mining offers a complementary approach to:                                                                                                                                        
- Predict biosynthetic potential before culturing
- Identify novel BGCs in understudied endophytes
- Prioritize strains for wet-lab investigation
- Connect genetic potential to observed bioactivity

This training bridges my experimental natural products work with modern bioinformatics approaches.
